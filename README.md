# Multilabel-classification-with-NLTK
In this tutorial, I will show you how to predict tags for a text. In this post, we will build a multi-label model thatâ€™s capable of detecting different types of toxicity in a large number of Wikipedia comments which have been labeled by human raters for toxic behavior. The types of toxicity are:

    toxic
    severe_toxic
    obscene
    threat
    insult
    identity_hate
The data set used can be downloaded at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jhoward/nb-svm-strong-linear-baseline/data) . there is a disclaimer on the data set that the dataset contains texts that may be considered profane, vulgar, or offensive. this is applicable to this tutorial as well.
